# DFIR-RAITH (Rapid Analysis & Incident Threat Hunt)

**Under semi-active development**

Things to expect:

- Jupyter Notebooks for Forensics and Threat Hunting
  - Linux
  - Windows
  - Memory Analysis
  - Yara
  - ...
- Dockerfiles to meet Notebook platform requirements

I've always enjoyed trying to automate mundane tasks, and I hope that with this project I can provide a useful service or starting point for people to do the same.
