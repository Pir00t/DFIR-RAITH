# YaraSeeker

After disliking pouring over results in a terminal window, I decided to make reviewing Yara output a bit more interactive.

## Use Cases

Personally, I use this for playing around with rule development and filtering results to allow for tuning. I've also found this useful when Reverse Engineering, being able to obtain a match offset and locate it in Ghidra.

## Usage

The provided Dockerfile can be used to spin up a container with the necessary requirements and based on the code structure being geared towards Jupyter Notebooks, is the recommended method for use.
